# Fantasy Base Modpack
### by karlexceed

This is a modpack that combines several other mods that I consider almost necessary for my Minetest worlds.

It combines:
- Baked Clay by TenPlus1 (bakedclay)
-- https://content.minetest.net/packages/TenPlus1/bakedclay/
- Biome Lib by VanessaE (biome_lib)
-- https://content.minetest.net/packages/VanessaE/biome_lib/
- Coloredwood by VanessaE (coloredwood)
-- https://content.minetest.net/packages/VanessaE/coloredwood/
- Ethereal NG by TenPlus1 (ethereal)
-- https://content.minetest.net/packages/TenPlus1/ethereal/
- Farming Redo by TenPlus1 (farming)
-- https://content.minetest.net/packages/TenPlus1/farming/
- Intllib by kaeza (intllib)
-- https://content.minetest.net/packages/kaeza/intllib/
- More Blocks by Calinou (moreblocks)
-- https://content.minetest.net/packages/Calinou/moreblocks/
- More Ores by Calinou (moreores)
-- https://content.minetest.net/packages/Calinou/moreores/
- More Trees! by VanessaE (moretrees)
-- https://content.minetest.net/packages/VanessaE/moretrees/
- Plantlife by VanessaE (plantlife_modpack)
-- https://content.minetest.net/packages/VanessaE/plantlife_modpack/
- Unified Dyes by VanessaE (unifieddyes)
-- https://content.minetest.net/packages/VanessaE/unifieddyes/

## Important Details

### Dependencies
Just the game's default stuff.

### Recommends
Nothing in particular.

### Conflicts
This mod should not be installed alongside the original, separate Poison Ivy, or old Bushes mods.  If those exist, delete them, as this mod supplies their functionality.  If you still use the old Jungle Grass mod either as previously supplied with this modpack, or in its standalone form, you'll want to delete the "junglegrass" directory from this modpack to get rid of the aliases-to-air that it supplies.

### Software Requirements
This mod requires Minetest 0.4.11 or later.  It is unlikely to work with old versions.

## Notes

Poison Ivy will spawn on grass and in some cases, on vertical surfaces including trees and jungle trees where they meet the dirt or grass.  Ivy previously spawned on the ground taller/thicker or start climbing up said vertical surfaces and trees.

At present, the poison ivy presents little more than an annoyance - they can only be cut down and either re-planted or thrown away.  No damage is done by harvesting them, yet. ;-)
